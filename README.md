# Chrome URL Rewrite/Redirect Extension
- Chrome Extension that I wrote to rewrite/redirect a user to the desired url with additional other functionality

# Features:
- Rewrite URL that matches specific pattern to desired URL pattern - replaces the desired text in the URL with target text
- Copy current URL to clipboard button - also does a string replace similarly to the first feature

# Benefits:
- Works great for Google Accounts making sure you never go to "Account 0" and instead always redirect to "Account 1"
- Google doesn't have a feature to set the primary google account so I wrote this for that use case to avoid the undesired google account I never log in to
